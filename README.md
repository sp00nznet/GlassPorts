# GlassPorts
Let's try to port all versions of Android 9 and below aosp to Google glass. Our build scripts will obtain all relevant files for one click builds of each major rev. These will work on windows and Linux. These ports need to be as feature complete as possible. We're targeting a very specific device and hardware so we can strip out non essential stuff. These should be able to boot up and run on Google glass rev 1 hw. It should include an easp ap mode for the device to offer a wifi network to connect to. The resultant system should have nothing but an android launcher and a settings menu. We want side loading enabled by default. The wifi ap should be a toggle in settings. Create whatever wrappers you need for the binary blobs.
